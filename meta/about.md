## About this site

The majority of information about the old site itself is available at [About This Wiki](../archive/about-this-wiki-archive.md). If you're looking for information about the site you are reading, it can be summed up as a partial archive of the original with the intent to allow further edits from future editors.

The original site has been offline since around 2014. It's been archived by crawlers on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/). But with how fragile information and storage is, I felt a personal need to archive something I was personally interested by.

### Have you changed anything from the original?

The format of the site is quite different. The original was a wiki. This is structured more as a documentation site. But they are both designed to be edited, commented upon, etc.

For the original text itself, there are liberties taken with the formatting and organisation of this site and what is archived. Part of it is out of laziness, part of it is a sense that there are better ways to organize the information, part of it is a sense that some things were too specific to the site itself (e.g. the sandbox page), etc.&#x20;

I believe it's still within the spirit of the original site itself: it was a wiki, it is meant to be changed and built upon to be as clean and clear as possible.

The majority of the text itself is left as is. You are welcome to leave any feedback you would like.

### Why the Lenore Thomson Exegesis wiki?

This site's author enjoyed reading it and found great insight from it as a teen; perhaps you will too. Maybe it comes from a sense of yearning for when the internet was a little warmer, more personable. Maybe it's from a life-long interest in trying to understand others. Maybe it's a bit of nostalgia for an old interest I had as a teen.

### How to participate here

The principles of the original [How to Participate Here](../archive/how-to-participate-here-archive.md) apply.&#x20;

My personal caveat is the site allows commenting on paragraphs directly. It would likely be tidier to use the comment and annotate functions that come with Gitbook than to edit your commentary on the page itself ala Wikipedia talk pages.

There are likely leftover links that direct to Wayback Machine pages rather than their internal equivalents. If you see leftover internal links like this, please redirect them to the corresponding page.&#x20;

I am currently debating if more personal pages (e.g. author subpages) should be archived on here.

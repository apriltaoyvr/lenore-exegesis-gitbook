See also _"_[_Implications of Beebe's Model from a Neurological Standpoint_](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]_"_, a discussion by Lenore of how John Beebe's notion of "complexes" that correspond to function attitudes might relate to different kinds of information processing going on in the brain. This article might shed a lot of light on how Lenore conceives of type, function attitudes, and how they relate and don't relate.

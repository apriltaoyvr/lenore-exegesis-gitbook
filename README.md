# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

This is a recreation of the original [_Lenore Thomson Exegesis Wiki_](https://web.archive.org/web/20071215002147/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/TheLenoreThomsonExegesisWiki) by [Ben Kovitz](https://wiki.c2.com/?BenKovitz). Why do this? You can learn more on the [About](meta/about.md#about-this-site) page.

For those familiar with [Myers-Briggs](people-and-systems/myers-briggs.md) but not [function attitudes](fundamentals/function-attitude/) or [Jungian functions](people-and-systems/carl-jung.md), the [Main Propositions](fundamentals/main-propositions.md) and [Not Personality](exegeses-and-hypotheses/not-personality/) will be of interest.&#x20;

## Original Introduction

Welcome to the Lenore Thomson exegesis wiki.&#x20;

[Lenore Thomson](people-and-systems/lenore-thomson/) is the author of [Personality Type: An Owner's Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Personality-Type-Practical-Understanding-Yourself-ebook/dp/B00KLFBMKG), a book that takes the [Myers-Briggs](people-and-systems/myers-briggs.md) personality type system back to its roots in [Jungian](people-and-systems/carl-jung.md) psychology. Or perhaps redefines [Myers-Briggs](people-and-systems/myers-briggs.md) as a vocabulary for analyzing politics and public discourse. We don't really know. On this web site, we try to figure out what she's talking about. You're invited to help (see below).

### About this web site

[Lenore Thomson](people-and-systems/lenore-thomson/)'s book is simply written, filled with examples and analogies from popular TV shows like Star Trek and The X Files. Even so, it can be maddeningly difficult to understand. She touches on a wide range of deep and broad topics from ancient philosophy to Sufism to contemporary pop culture. She seems to have something very definite in mind by her many [terms with nonobvious meanings](https://web.archive.org/web/20071215002147/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/terms_with_nonobvious_meanings). She never really quite defines them, though, and it's difficult to pin down her meaning.

[Lenore ](people-and-systems/lenore-thomson/)is the first popular author to go into depth about what the [function attitudes](fundamentals/function-attitude/) are, and she turns [Myers-Briggs](people-and-systems/lenore-thomson/) from a system of personality classification to a path of personal growth, something like the [Enneagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality). Her book might also be a vocabulary of mental [heuristics](https://web.archive.org/web/20071215002147/http://greenlightwiki.com/heuristic), a unified view of many conflicting strands of philosophic thought (perhaps what [Carl Jung](people-and-systems/carl-jung.md) intended), and an analysis of how and why people's rhetorical expectations sometimes clash. We don't really know quite what to make of her book--hence this web site.

This wiki is a place where we explore what [Lenore Thomson](people-and-systems/lenore-thomson/) is talking about by trying to put it into our own words--[exegesis](https://web.archive.org/web/20071215002147/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/exegesis). The text on this wiki is written by anyone who cares to post, and edited and rewritten by anyone who cares to edit and rewrite. We welcome all [Lenore](people-and-systems/lenore-thomson/)-related ideas: what's posted here is not necessarily correct, it's not checked or approved by [Lenore Thomson](people-and-systems/lenore-thomson/), and it's not necessarily any clearer than [Lenore](people-and-systems/lenore-thomson/)'s original writing. If you find what looks like an internal contradiction here, it probably is. We make no attempt to be consistent; we're looking for many different angles on [Lenore](people-and-systems/lenore-thomson/)'s stuff. The only [Lenore](people-and-systems/lenore-thomson/)-related topic we're not interested in is judgements of whether her ideas are right or wrong. We leave that to the reader.

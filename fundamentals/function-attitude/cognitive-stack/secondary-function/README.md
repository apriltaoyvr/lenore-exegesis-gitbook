# Secondary Function

An alternate or auxiliary [Function Attitude](../../) in addition to one's [Dominant Function](../dominant-function.md).&#x20;

The **Secondary Function** gives extraverts access to something beyond what is immediately apparent or applicable; and it gives introverts access to public, worldly matters. A person's Secondary Function doesn't directly conflict with the person's [Dominant Function](../dominant-function.md) even though it's [Oriented](../../../../sign-interpretation/orienting/) by the opposite world (extraverted/introverted).

One of [Lenore](../../../../people-and-systems/lenore-thomson.md)'s [Main Propositions](../../../main-propositions.md) seems to be that the Secondary Function often provides a person's main path of growth, once they've established a definite personality--one strong enough to start running into self-created limitations.&#x20;

Some explorations of how this might work are on [Saints-and-Politicians Exegesis](../../../../exegeses-and-hypotheses/introversion-extraversion/saints-and-politicians.md), [Place-Your-Stakes Exegesis](../../../../exegeses-and-hypotheses/introversion-extraversion/place-your-stakes.md), and [Checks and Balances](../../../../far-flung-explorations/checks-and-balances.md).

# ðŸ§  Function Attitude

{% hint style="info" %}
[Lenore](../../people-and-systems/lenore-thomson/) often refers to function-attitudes just as "**functions**", which goes back to Jung.

On this wiki, we lean toward the more intuitively clear word "**attitudes**".
{% endhint %}

A _function-attitude_ is a [Jungian](../../people-and-systems/carl-jung.md) function used in an Extraverted or Introverted [attitude](attitude.md). Each type uses a combination of the four functions in a preferred order.&#x20;

## Functions

In [Lenore'](../../people-and-systems/lenore-thomson/)s system, there are four functions:

* [Sensation](perception/sensation/)
* [Intuition](perception/intuition/)
* [Thinking](judgement/thinking/)
* [Feeling](judgement/feeling/)

These are commonly grouped into **Perception** (Sensation and Intuition) and **Judgment** (Thinking and Feeling) within [Jungian ](../../people-and-systems/carl-jung.md)typology. [**Irrational** and **rational**](../our-difficulties/terms-with-nonobvious-meanings/rational-and-irrational.md) are used respectively as well, albeit differently than common utilisation.

| Perception/Irrational | Judgment/Rational |
| --------------------- | ----------------- |
| Sensation             | Thinking          |
| Intuition             | Feeling           |

See [Truth-and-Language Exegesis](../../exegeses-and-hypotheses/truth-and-language.md) for more information on why this may be.

## Function-attitudes

These four functions are then split into introverted and extraverted functions according to how one [orients](../../sign-interpretation/orienting/) themselves.

| Extraverted                                                                    | Introverted                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Extraverted Sensation (Se)](perception/sensation/extraverted-sensation-se.md) | [Introverted Sensation (Si)](perception/sensation/introverted-sensation-si.md) |
| [Extraverted Intuition (Ne)](perception/intuition/extraverted-intuition-ne.md) | [Introverted Intuition (Ni)](perception/intuition/introverted-intuition-ni.md) |
| [Extraverted Thinking (Te)](judgement/thinking/extraverted-thinking-te/)       | [Introverted Thinking (Ti)](judgement/thinking/introverted-thinking-ti.md)     |
| [Extraverted Feeling (Fe)](judgement/feeling/extraverted-feeling-fe.md)        | [Introverted Feeling (Fi)](judgement/feeling/introverted-feeling-fi.md)        |

Exactly what a function-attitude _is_ is the main part of the [Definition Problem](../our-difficulties/definition-problem/). See also [Genus Problem](../our-difficulties/definition-problem/genus-problem.md).

## [Jung](../../people-and-systems/carl-jung.md)'s choice of terminology

_Q._ Why did Jung choose the term "function"?

_A._ Perhaps to get psychology to sound like physics or mathematics.

_...any other answers?_

_A._ Jung, _Psychological Types_, p.273: He borrow terms coined by _Otto Gross_. The "primary function" and the "secondary function".

A. Random House definition of function: #1 the kind of action or activity proper to any person or thing #2 the purpose for which something is designed or exists. As an INFJ, it makes perfect sense to me. Your function is what serves your purpose, it is what's proper to yourself.

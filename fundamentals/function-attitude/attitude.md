An attitude is a direction a function can have. Extraversion is focused on the "other", the external (what is outside of the self).

## Extraversion

> W.H Auden's poem [The Unknown Citizen](https://poets.org/poem/unknown-citizen) describes someone's life completely in extraverted terms.&#x20;

See also [Negotiation Basics](../../exegeses-and-hypotheses/negotiation.md#negotiation-basics) for another angle on exploring extraversion.

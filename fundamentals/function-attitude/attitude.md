Some hypotheses are at:

* [Orienting](../../sign-interpretation/orienting/)
* [Cocooning-vs.-Conforming Exegesis](../../exegeses-and-hypotheses/cocooning-vs.-conforming.md)
* [Game-Board Exegesis](../../exegeses-and-hypotheses/game-board.md)
* [Negotiation Exegesis](../../exegeses-and-hypotheses/negotiation-exegesis.md)
* [Saints-and-Politicians Exegesis](../../exegeses-and-hypotheses/saints-and-politicians.md)

## Extraversion

> W.H Auden's poem [The Unknown Citizen](https://poets.org/poem/unknown-citizen) describes someone's life completely in extraverted terms.&#x20;

See also [Negotiation Basics](../../exegeses-and-hypotheses/negotiation-exegesis.md#negotiation-basics) for another angle on exploring extraversion.

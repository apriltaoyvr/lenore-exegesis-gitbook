# Introverted Intuition (Ni)

## Quasi-defining statements

> p. 222: "...draws our attention to immediate sensory phenomena. ... It prompts an interest in perception itself--the process of recognizing and interpreting what we take in."
>
> p. 223: "Introverted Intuition would prompt us to liberate our sense impressions from their larger context, thereby creating new options for perception itself."
>
> p. 229: "Introverted Intuitions are not really ideas. They're like trains at the edge of articulated knowledge. You can't claim them or advocate them. You put on a hat, grab hold of a boxcar door, and see where they go."
>
> p. 153: "Introverted Intuition suggests that absolute meaning is an illusion--the result of having incomplete information."

As a [dominant function](../../cognitive-stack/dominant-function.md):

> p. 225: "For INJs, patterns aren't 'out there' in the world, waiting to be discovered. They're part of _us_--the way we make sense of the riot of energy and information impinging on our systems. A disease syndrome is a useful construct, but that's all it is--an aggregate of observations attached to a label, telling us what to see and how to deal with it."
>
> p. 225: "Where Extraverted Intuitives see many behavioral options, INJs acknowledge many conceptual standpoints. They experience no need to declare one inherently better than another. Indeed, these types have the disconcerting habit of solving a problem by shifting their perspective and defining the situation some other way."
>
> p. 234: "For INJs, truth isn't about logic. Truth is a frame of reference, a way of organizing information, which serves one set of needs or another."

## Proposed Definitions

### #1: Seeing past interpretations

**Introverted Intuition** (Ni) is the attitude that whatever is manifest (apparent, observable, described) is only the tiniest fraction of the total reality and all of its potential, and it is manifest only because it serves a purpose--a purpose that it achieves by exploiting a certain way of interpreting or navigating by signs. Ni is attunement to what lurks in the shadow of that manifestation. What _is_ that assumed way of interpreting or navigating? What could we see if we were free of it?

### #2: What cannot be said?

**Introverted Intuition** is the attitude of attunement to what cannot be said, by virtue of the structuring that "saying" requires.

_For example:_ At work, we don't dare say our true feelings (or we can only say them if they're positive), because we know that sharing them would bring dire economic consequences. There is no other way, because the structure of the workplace (people working cooperatively to get stuff done that they get paid for) requires that people refrain from saying anything that might put their loyalty in doubt. If an accountant, in his office, says that he loves accounting, you view this as meaningless because, well, what else is he going to say? In fact, he might very well hate accounting. You have to be highly attuned to what's _really_ going on in order to read the true meaning of what people say--which is often the opposite of the literal meaning of their words. (See [Eric Berne](https://web.archive.org/web/20061116224153/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/Eric_Berne).)

_For example:_ Why do we put North at the top of most maps? Because the mapmaking tradition began among northern-dwelling people, who considered people who lived further south to be less important. Putting North at the top of the map frames geography in a way that, perhaps unwittingly, conveys the belief that Europeans are better or more important than Africans. This can't be said by anything within the map; the very way that the map is structured and related to reality says it.

_For example:_ What does music mean? You can't say it. It's ineffable. (See [Introverted Intuition and the Meaning of Music](../../../../far-flung-explorations/introverted-intuition-and-the-meaning-of-music.md).) What is God? What is spirit? Any attempt to capture these things in words only cheapens them.

Introverted Intuition is an attitude of "seeing through" the distortion that any interpretation creates, to see the underlying reality. It's a left-brain attitude in that it's sign- and symbol-oriented: attempting to grasp the system of interpretation that makes any particular way of representing reality work, as a prerequisite for using that system. From an Ni ego-state, you want to understand the assumptions of a system of representation before you use the system, so that you can use it with true freedom--including the freedom to use the built-in interpretations in ways that violate those assumptions.

### #3: Orientation by manner of orientation

Introverted Intuition is a way of orienting yourself to your environment by consciously attending to the expected interpretations of things. In this manner of orientation, you hold agnostic about whether those interpretations are true. You view them as expected interpretations, nothing more. Your world is a world of expected interpretations defined by others; you navigate through those interpretations and use them without regard to whether they're true, always keeping the interpretations separate in your mind from the actual objects.

For example, whereas from an [Extraverted Sensation](../sensation/extraverted-sensation-se.md) perspective, you might feel very impressed upon meeting a man wearing a fancy Italian suit (signs call forth a natural response and need no interpretation); from an Ni perspective, you would consciously say to yourself that he's wearing an Italian suit and this is supposed to make you think he's wealthy or upper-class or really has his act together or something like that, and therefore is supposed to make you feel impressed (signs and what they mean are connected only arbitrarily). Whether he really does have his act together is a matter upon which you reserve judgement. Consequently you don't feel impressed. You merely note the expected interpretation as no less a part of your environment than the suit itself.

Without knowing the expected interpretations of a system--the way signs are interpreted within that system, and the expected responses that make the system work--you can't get [oriented ](../../../../sign-interpretation/orienting/)via Ni. The expected interpretations must be stabilized and clear to you. _Then_ you can comment from an outside perspective, or see ways to respond to the signs that violate the system's assumptions, or simply know how to operate the thing. First you have to get "outside" it, then you can deal with it. The process of "getting outside it" can take a long time. As you identify expected interpretations, you find yourself uncovering ever more and more hidden assumptions, and you feel the need to distance yourself from those, too, before you get your hands dirty or draw a conclusion.

### #4: Just knowing

Ni is a way of knowing (or at least thinking you know) that bypasses reason, facts, evidence, the expected or intended interpretations of signs, or anything you can point to, simply giving you an awareness or belief that seems indisputably true to you, period. You can't tell by introspection how you got this idea. There is no thought process. There is only tuning into this form of awareness and _just knowing._

_For example:_ You've been interviewing candidates for a job. One of them has all the credentials, and scored the highest on all the company-defined criteria for the job. Another of them was pretty good but not in the same league. You have a sense about the high-scorer, though, that he's bad news, and that the "so-so" one will work out well. You can't point to anything that's let you to this conclusion, you can't justify your belief, but you have this sense just the same. To _trust_ this unjustifiable idea is to orient by [introverted intuition](introverted-intuition-ni.md).

_For example:_ The song [_Bad Moon Rising_](https://genius.com/Creedence-clearwater-revival-bad-moon-rising-lyrics) illustrates an Ni sense of danger. The belief is strong yet vague.

_For example:_ A co-worker calls you on the phone and says that he has a cold and won't be able to come in that day. You "see through" what he said: you "just know" it's a lie: really he has an interview at another company. You can't point to a single thing that leads you to such a specific conclusion, and yet there it is.

_For example:_ You are trying to solve some problem--an interpersonal problem, a mathematical problem, it could be anything. Everything seems to be snared and confused. You ask yourself, "What's really going on here?" And an answer comes.

_For example:_ Jack Groverland (ENTJ?) preaches to "be still" and just "tune in to what that greater intelligence that is the universe wants you to do."

With [extraverted intuition](extraverted-intuition-ne.md), you bypass the socially defined interpretations of signs by broadening the context, and thus relate to other people's ideas in a definite way: you propose something "[outside the box](https://web.archive.org/web/20061116224153/http://greenlightwiki.com/improv/Outside_the_Box)"--the box that other people are thinking in. You expect that other people's minds will be blown, probably pleasantly, inducing a feeling of "wow!" With [introverted intuition](introverted-intuition-ni.md), you also bypass the expected interpretations of signs, but your belief is self-contained, and you have no sense that anyone else would find it interesting or compelling. It came to you, for no reason that you can fathom, and you can't show anyone else any reason why they should take it seriously. The belief might be very specific, too vague for words, or even too specific for words.

[Orienting ](../../../../sign-interpretation/orienting/)by Ni, you are likely to view belief as something that simply arises within each person when they tune into it. If two people have different beliefs, there is no resolving it. I have my belief and you have yours. End of story. New ideas or evidence seem beside the point. If you think there's a bad moon rising, how could mere "evidence" persuade you otherwise?

#### Lenore doesn't talk much about this

Lenore's writing doesn't emphasize this aspect of Ni. It's hidden in little notes here and there, like the way tertiary Ni can give ISFPs the will to hold to a belief even when others don't agree with it, or the way ENTJs "see around the corners" of an organization's official rules. For the most part, Lenore emphasizes neutrality between conflicting ideas. The present hypothesis proposes that this emphasis is a possible, maybe illustrative, but not necessary consequence of the basic idea: "just knowing" in a way that bypasses built-in or conventional interpretations of signs: seeing past the signs, and just "getting" the truth (or at least thinking you have).

## As a language of [Ego Orientation](../../../../sign-interpretation/orienting/ego-orientation.md)

As a [Dominant Function](../../cognitive-stack/dominant-function.md), Ni leads INJs to anchor themselves primarily in discovery of and attunement to that "what else"--to seek communion with it for its own sake. INJs are typically concerned with finding an independent and all-encompassing perspective on whatever interests them, so they can see it without bias, without being fooled or led along by ways in which other interests have set things up, and without a merely partial understanding.

As a [Secondary Function](../../cognitive-stack/secondary-function/), Ni typically leads ENJs to be aware of alternative ways of negotiating the social world, that exploit the assumptions that people make in order for there to be a social world. One might use this awareness to be on guard against cheaters, to prevail by setting knots and traps for others to fall into, to commit to a vision that might currently seem impossible, or a thousand other ways to serve or create an Extraverted goal.

As a [Tertiary Function](../../cognitive-stack/tertiary-function/), Ni typically leads ISPs to suspect others of hypocrisy and cheating and putting on appearances aimed at exploiting people's credulity--especially hypocrisy inherent in social institutions. Sometimes ISPs draw upon Ni to find ways to throw a monkey wrench into social systems that call them into some kind of obligation: to respond in ways that don't make sense within the system's explicitly stated ways of interpreting behavior as cooperative or hostile (but are indeed hostile).

As an [Inferior Function](../../cognitive-stack/inferior-function.md), Ni typically leads ESPs to either self-doubt or claim to a mystic vision--to see themselves as an oracle of transcendent truth, bypassing the need for finding things out through observation, reasoning, and putting ideas to a test.

Naturally, you can see plenty of dominant-style Ni in ENJs, secondary-style Ni in INJs, and so on--even inferior-style Ni in INJs.

## What do ant pheromones mean?

The following might illustrate [Introverted Intuition](introverted-intuition-ni.md) as a [Semiotic Attitude](../../../../sign-interpretation/semiotic-attitude/).

There are certain organisms that live as parasites on ant colonies. They live nearly motionless most of their lives, inside an ant colony. Ants bring them food. Ants just keep on bringing them more and more food, which the parasites eat and eat and eat.

Why do the ants do that? Because the parasite emits the same pheromones that ant larvae emit to signal that they need to be fed. It doesn't matter that the parasite grows to 20 times the size of an ant larva and never seems to take a break from eating. The ants receive the pheromone that means "I'm a larva and I'm hungry" and they obey.

What, then, do those pheromones really mean? From the standpoint of Introverted Intuition, the pheromones do not mean "I'm a larva and I'm hungry." Clearly they don't mean that, because they can be sent by non-larvae. What they mean is _the way the ants respond._

More generally, the meaning of a sign is whatever an interpreter of the sign does with it, not something external to the interpreter.

Heuristically, Introverted Intuition can lead you to use signals in ways that have nothing to do with or go directly against their built-in or "intended" interpretations. Hence the common INJ fondness for irony.

#### Against this hypothesis

responsiveness - this seems more [extraverted sensation](../sensation/extraverted-sensation-se.md) in orientation. You respond to the moment. Modifying effect to get a response. (ie. [Lenore](../../../../people-and-systems/lenore-thomson/) p.151: _finally admitted to his girlfriend he was never really a vegetarian; he just liked the reactions he got with socially conscious women_). Ni would recognize that people are doing this and then describe it, Se would innately recognize it and exploit it. -- [Robert Evans](https://web.archive.org/web/20061116224153/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/Robert_Evans)

## Hypotheses&#x20;

### Science and semiotics

Introverted Intuitives (especially INTJs), when oriented to science (especially the social sciences), tend to become entranced with semiotics (how signs are interpreted and objects are seen as signs), as in the first Quasi-defining statement.

### About reading: genres, etc...

Significant subsets of introverted intuitives (particularly INTJs) are drawn to Cyberpunk. This genre most encapsulating INTJs [inferior function](../../cognitive-stack/inferior-function.md) [Sensation ](../sensation/)desire for physical and mental supremacy (or, ideally, a world in which strength and charisma have no power). (Though it's possible other types will be drawn to it for differing reasons)

## Prometheus Rising as a guidebook on Ni

Robert Anton Wilson's [_Prometheus Rising_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28597.Prometheus_Rising) discusses cognition and semiotics. "Reality tunnels" are how people are bound by patterns on what they _want to see_ or are "programmed" to see and distorting information to fit their narrative.

> When we meet somebody whose separate tunnel-reality is obviously far different from ours, we are a bit frightened and always disoriented. We tend to think they are mad, or that they are crooks trying to con us in some way, or that they are hoaxers playing a joke. Yet it is neurologically obvious that no two brains have the same genetically-programmed hard wiring, the same imprints, the same conditioning, the same learning experiences. We are all living in separate realities. That is why communication fails so often, and misunderstandings and resentments are so common. I say "meow" and you say "Bow-wow," and each of us is convinced the other is a bit dumb.
>
> Every kind of ignorance in the world all results from not realizing that our perceptions are gambles. We believe what we see and then we believe our interpretation of it, we don't even know we are making an interpretation most of the time. We think this is reality.
>
> The Prover is a much simpler mechanism. It operates on one law only: Whatever the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves.

He believes we are limited by subjective perceptions and judgements we attach to ideas. The "Thinker" are our preconceptions and the "Prover" is what assigns and justifies our biases to the reality around us.

Challenging these preconceptions is a reoccurring theme in his works. Each chapter of _Prometheus Rising_ ends with [exercises](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IIpyJRSyu7oC25SDMjJRh0ObM0Koe0mHJsImNiK84ZQ/edit?tab=t.0) on shifting your perception of the same events and observing the change in your thinking (Ni). Example:

> * Visualize a quarter vividly, and imagine vividly that you are going to find the quarter on the street. Then, look for the quarter every time you take a walk, meanwhile continuing to visualize it. See how long it takes you to find the quarter.&#x20;
> * Explain the above experiment by the hypothesis of "selective attention"—that is, believe there are lots of lost quarters everywhere and you were bound to find one by continually looking. Go looking for a second quarter.&#x20;
> * Explain the experiment by the alternative "mystical" hypothesis that "mind controls everything." Believe that you made the quarter manifest in this universe. Go looking for a second quarter. If the reader is a scientist, be not alarmed. This refers not to you but only to those benighted fools in the opposite camp who refuse to recognize that your theory is the only reasonable one. Of course.&#x20;

This lines up well with Lenore's descriptions and the proposed definitions of Ni on this wiki, in particular [Tea Leaves and Tarot Cards](../../../../far-flung-explorations/tea-leaves-and-tarot-cards.md). Considering shifting reality tunnels is a reoccurring theme in his writings, he is an INJ. \

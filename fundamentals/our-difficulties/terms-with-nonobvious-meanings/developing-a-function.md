# Developing A Function

[Lenore ](../../../people-and-systems/lenore-thomson/)uses the concept of "developing a function" pretty heavily. Her basic proposition seems to be that when you're stuck in life, you can make rapid progress by [developing your Secondary Function](../../function-attitude/cognitive-stack/secondary-function/developing-the-secondary.md) a bit more.

A great frustration of the book, though, is that she gives only the barest hints of what that means.

The [Saints-and-Politicians Exegesis](../../../exegeses-and-hypotheses/saints-and-politicians.md) explores one idea for what it means to develop the [Secondary Function](../../function-attitude/cognitive-stack/secondary-function/). [Place-Your-Stakes Exegesis](../../../exegeses-and-hypotheses/place-your-stakes.md) explores another.

# Developing A Function

[Lenore ](../../../people-and-systems/lenore-thomson/)uses the concept of "developing a function" pretty heavily. Her basic proposition seems to be that when you're stuck in life, you can make rapid progress by [developing your Secondary Function](../../function-attitude/cognitive-stack/secondary-function/developing-the-secondary.md) a bit more.

A great frustration of the book, though, is that she gives only the barest hints of what that means.

The [Saints-and-Politicians Exegesis](../../../exegeses-and-hypotheses/introversion-extraversion/saints-and-politicians.md) explores one idea for what it means to develop the [Secondary Function](../../function-attitude/cognitive-stack/secondary-function/). [Place-Your-Stakes Exegesis](../../../exegeses-and-hypotheses/introversion-extraversion/place-your-stakes.md) explores another.

## In terms of negotiation

If, as described on [Negotiation Basics](https://web.archive.org/web/20060620054644/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/Negotiation_Basics) and [Negotiation Exegesis](https://web.archive.org/web/20060620054644/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/Negotiation_Exegesis), extraversion is seeing things in terms of negotiation, perhaps developing an extraverted [Function Attitude](https://web.archive.org/web/20060620054644/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/Function_Attitude) means doing things to improve your bargaining position. That would mean things like finding out what's available, finding out what people are interested in, finding contacts to bring you information about opportunities, and cultivating skills to make yourself marketable.

Then what would it mean to develop introversion, though?

Perhaps anchoring yourself in a kind of knowledge or attitude that persists through time and that you can carry with you wherever you go.\

# Terms With Nonobvious Meanings

Some of us find terms in Lenore's book difficult to attach a clear meaning to. Sometimes the experience is as if there is white-out over the word. Neither context nor prior experience with the word suggests an obvious or definite meaning.

* Functions
  * [Sensation](../../function-attitude/perception/sensation/)
  * [Intuition](../../function-attitude/perception/intuition/)
  * [Feeling](../../function-attitude/judgement/feeling/)
  * [Thinking](../../function-attitude/judgement/thinking/)
* Extroversion and Introversion ([Attitudes](../../function-attitude/attitude.md))
* [Function Attitudes](../../function-attitude/)
* [Rational and Irrational](rational-and-irrational.md)
* [Developing a function](developing-a-function.md)
* Logical Probabilities
* Imaginal

## Objective and Subjective

### Quasi-defining statement

> p. 176: "By _subjective_ I mean that a person's ideas about what matters are unique to himself or herself."
>
> p. 321: "The word _objective_ simply means 'having material existence.' We’re disposed to hear this, however, as though it meant ‘existentially indifferent.’ Thus, general principles seem objective to us because they have nothing do to do with our behaviors as people; they’re abstractions—like the letters of the alphabet, or the concepts of unity and duality. Values, on the other hand, are personal and human. When they change, our behaviors change."

# Terms With Nonobvious Meanings

Some of us find terms in Lenore's book difficult to attach a clear meaning to. Sometimes the experience is as if there is white-out over the word. Neither context nor prior experience with the word suggests an obvious or definite meaning.

* Functions
  * [Sensation](../../function-attitude/perception/sensation/)
  * [Intuition](../../function-attitude/perception/intuition/)
  * [Feeling](../../function-attitude/judgement/feeling/)
  * [Thinking](../../function-attitude/judgement/thinking/)
* Extroversion and Introversion ([Attitudes](../../function-attitude/attitude.md))
* [Function Attitudes](../../function-attitude/)
* [Rational and Irrational](rational-and-irrational.md)
* [Developing a function](developing-a-function.md)
* Objective and Subjective
* Logical Probabilities
* Imaginal

## Objective and Subjective

### Quasi-defining statement

> p. 176: "By _subjective_ I mean that a person's ideas about what matters are unique to himself or herself."

One can assume **objective** is the inverse: Ideas which are shared and collective.

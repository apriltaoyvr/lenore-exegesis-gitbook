# Superego

_Hypothesis:_ What [Lenore](../people-and-systems/lenore-thomson/) means by different [function attitudes](../fundamentals/function-attitude/) is what Freud meant by id, ego, and superego.

Fe and Te are superego functions.

Se and Ne are ego functions.

If you truly do not have a sense of self as distinct, you truly do not have an ego. If a function-attitude as a dominant does not have a sense of self as unique (and thus uniquely important), that function-attitude is not an ego-attitude. (That is, if your dominant function is not an ego-function, you're going to have to hit another function for a sense of ego. -- that is, [Lenore](../people-and-systems/lenore-thomson/) on EFJs[^1] hitting their [tertiary function](https://web.archive.org/web/20060627203321/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/tertiary_function) to experiment with their ability to stay up late and play hard, ETJs[^2] hitting their tertiary as a means to just quit regardless of the consequences, etc....)

When functioning as a dominant, a superego function (that is, [extraverted feeling](https://web.archive.org/web/20060627203321/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/extraverted_feeling)) will not be oriented by the self.

***

Another hypothesis: The [Secondary Function](../fundamentals/function-attitude/cognitive-stack/secondary-function/) is the means by which a person orients himself to the superego. It follows that the [Tertiary Function](https://web.archive.org/web/20060627203321/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/Tertiary_Function) is the means by which a person orients himself to the id, while the actual contents of the id (unconscious) are accessed via the [Inferior Function](https://web.archive.org/web/20060627203321/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/Inferior_Function).

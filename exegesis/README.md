# Exegesis

_Exegesis_ is the attempt to spell out an interpretation of a text, or to figure out what is the most accurate interpretation of a text.

The word is most commonly applied to the study of texts like the Bible or Aristotle's treatises. These texts use a lot of words and concepts that are not familiar to modern readers, and assume a lot of knowledge of their readers that few people possess today. Consequently, to understand them today, you need some help: someone to tell you the things the authors of those texts assumed of their readers, what the main controversies of the day were, etc.

The word _exegesis_ comes from Greek roots meaning "to lead the way". Perhaps that's because such texts, to be understood, require a guide.

With [Lenore](../people-and-systems/lenore-thomson/)'s book, we don't have a guide, so we're just trying a lot of paths.\
